# # - strings, letters, numbers, or any other stuff 
# # you can make with a keyboard
# # a Variables is just a fasy way to refer to something else
# # variables do not make the program faster.
# # They make the program slower!
# # Variables make it easier for us to write programs.

# # Data types:
# #     - Programming languages see different types of variables differently 
# #     - string - English stuff. 
# #     - Number - any integer and for example 2.2e10
# #     - - Floats and integers
# #     - Floats = has a decimal within the value
# #     Booleans - true or false, on or off, 1 or 0, yes or no, right or left
# #     list - list of things
# #     dictionaries - variable of variables
# #     object - super dictionaries

# # Primitive Data types = string, number, boolean

# Math = +, -, /, *, %
# print 2+2
# print 2-2
